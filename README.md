# Python LearnSpace
Since I've been working with Python for the past few months, I figure it would be cool to have some documentation of my incremental progress. This will include snippets of code and smaller projects that I'll be keeping as notes. If anyone else sees this and is interested in learning Python for themselves or if I want some quick reference, it'll be here.
